## R Markdown g

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
df = read.csv("C:/Users/ublak/OneDrive/Desktop/DS_202/gapminder-5060.csv")
df
library(tidyverse)
```

## Including Plots
# 1. Finish the in-class practice in Slides 3-12 in "Lecture 2-2-Practice for git", link: https://yumouqiu.github.io/DS202-Spring2023/Practice/practice01.html  
    a. Download the RMarkdown file with these homework instructions to use as a template for your work. Make sure to replace "Your Name" with your name.  
    b. In the RMarkdown file, write down table of team members, and their github repository links;   
the number of successful pull requests you made, and the github repository to which you requested a change;  
the number of pull requests you accepted, and the github repository from which you accepted.  
    c. Write down a list with at least 3 tips of how to make working with git/github easier
    1. Practice with a mock or fake example with the pulling and pushing you will have to do for the real project
    2. Fork your partner's repository to make working together easier and quicker
    3. Connect your RStudio with git to make pushing as easy as a click of a button
You can also embed plots, for example:
# Question 2: Generate the graph of LifExp vs. gdpPercap for US, Canada, Aussie's
```{r}
df1 = df1 %>% filter(country == "Canada")
df2 = df2 %>% filter(country == "United States")
df3 = df3 %>% filter(country == "Australia")
df1 = df1 %>% mutate(lifeExp = replace(lifeExp, lifeExp == 999999, 69.96))
ggplot(df1, aes(x=lifeExp, y = gdpPercap)) + geom_point()
ggplot(df2, aes(x=lifeExp, y = gdpPercap)) + geom_point()
ggplot(df3, aes(x=lifeExp, y = gdpPercap)) + geom_point()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Question 3 Write a paragraph (~200 words) describing an example of what you consider data science. Write your paragraph in R Markdown. Include at least 
    a. one link to a chart or an image and 
    b. at least one itemized or enumerated list.
    


*Things I believe that are considered data science can vary heavily on what we are talking about but I believe something popular that is considered data science would the use of popular AI programs that have been popping up in recent history with the current rise of ChatGPT in the past couple of weeks. Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT uses natural language processing (NLP), an AI technology that deals with understanding, analyzing, and generating human-like language. The large language model (LLM) was trained using a combination of two major inputs. A massive volume of sample text pulled from web pages and program code before the end of 2021. And Conversations provided by real humans, who demonstrated the desired responses to provided prompts, then ranked outputs from the model based on the quality of the response*
